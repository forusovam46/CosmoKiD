        <h2>The Elements in Our Bodies</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered where the elements that make up your body come from? The <span class="color-pinkish">carbon</span> in your muscles, the <span class="color-bluish">calcium</span> in your bones, and the <span class="color-greenish">iron</span> in your blood were all formed in the cores of stars through a process called <span class="color-yellowish">nucleosynthesis</span>.</p>
        
        <!-- Big Bang Nucleosynthesis -->
        <h2>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</h2>
        <p>Right after the Big Bang, the universe was incredibly hot and dense. In the first few minutes, the lightest elements and least complex elements formed. This period is known as <span class="color-reddish">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</span>. During this time, hydrogen, helium, and tiny amounts of lithium were created. These elements are the building blocks for everything in the universe!</p>

        <!-- Stellar Nucleosynthesis -->
        <h2>Stellar Nucleosynthesis</h2>
        <p>Stars are like giant nuclear reactors. In their intense heat and pressure, lighter elements like <span class="color-pinkish">hydrogen</span> and <span class="color-bluish">helium</span> fuse together to form heavier elements. This process is called <span class="color-yellowish">stellar nucleosynthesis</span>. It's how elements like <span class="color-greenish">carbon</span>, <span class="color-yellowish">oxygen</span>, and <span class="color-reddish">iron</span> are formed.</p>
        
        <!-- Supernovae and Other Cosmic Events -->
        <h2>Supernovae and Other Cosmic Events</h2>
        <p>When massive stars run out of fuel, they can explode in spectacular supernovae, creating and scattering even heavier elements across the galaxy. These explosions, along with other cosmic events, contribute to the redistribution of matter in the universe. For example, a <span class="color-pinkish">Type II supernova</span> occurs when a massive star collapses under its own gravity. A <span class="color-bluish">Type Ia supernova</span> happens in a binary system when a white dwarf star steals matter from its companion star until it explodes. These events create many of the elements heavier than iron, like gold and uranium, and spread them throughout the cosmos.</p>

        <!-- Our Connection to the Stars -->
        <h2>Our Cosmic Connection</h2>
        <p>Every atom in your body was once part of a star. This means <span class="color-greenish">we are all made of star dust</span>! The next time you look up at the night sky, remember that you're connected to those distant stars in a very real way.</p>

        <p>A Type Ia supernova occurs in binary systems where a white dwarf star accretes matter from its companion star until it reaches a critical mass and explodes. This explosion scatters elements created in the star's core across the galaxy, mixing with interstellar gas and dust to form new stars, planets, and even living organisms. It's a reminder of our profound connection to the cosmos and the incredible journey of the elements that make up everything we see around us.</p>
